Adds a sidebar widget to display Guido van Biemen's (aka MrGuide@NL) Teamspeak Display Preview Release 3 (GPL) and uses [AjaxCore 1.2.2]http://ajaxcore.sourceforge.net to refresh it.

It is deployed on [my blog](http://www.gehirnfurz.com/tsviewerwidget/), for reference.

3. Extract it in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
